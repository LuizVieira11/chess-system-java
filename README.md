# Chess System with Java

This project is a chess game using pure Java Object oriented principles, such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and other concepts.  
The central idea of this program was to train my abilities of logic and knowledge in object oriented programming.  
The game is fully functioning and intuitive, all errors that the user can make were treated and even the special moves were implemented (Castling, En Passant and Promotion).
